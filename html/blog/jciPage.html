      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        NCR, also known as the National Cash Register, is an international software and technology company that specializes in automated teller machines and software for banks. 
        During my work term, NCR split into two companies: NCR Voyix and NCR Atleos. 
        In this report, I will talk about my work experience as a backend developer at NCR Voyix, which focuses on providing software to banks.
      </p>

      <h1>Job requirements</h1>
      <p>
        The job description for the software developer role is vast, as the posting requires many different roles like frontend, backend, and full-stack. 
        The company will then find you a role that matches your interests and expertise. Since I was selected as a backend developer, I will discuss the requirements for a backend developer.
        <br><br>
        The requirement for a backend developer is proficiency in Java development as the primary requirement, 
        with other knowledge like docker, Kubernetes, Linux, and Spring Boot as the secondary requirements. 
        This is because most of the backend for NCR is using Java, so knowing how to use the language is very important.
      </p>

      <h1>Learning Goals</h1>
      <p>
        In this work term, my learning goal focused on my team’s duty, which is mainly on fixing existing problems and maintaining services. 
        So not only will I be working with Java, but I will also be working with technologies for servers like Docker and Kubernetes. Here are my learning goals:
      </p>

      <h2>Goal 1: Design and develop new software tools using new and known technologies</h2>
      <p>
        From my early communication with my team lead, I know that I will develop an important tool that will help make the team’s job easier by using Jenkins. 
        This description made me look forward to doing the task, not only because I will be able to make a major contribution to my team but also 
        because I will learn a new technology with it that can help me stand out.
        <br><br>
        Before developing the tools, I consulted with my lead developer about the requirements. 
        I can move into development without much problem once I confirm all the requirements. 
        The end product is a tool that helps our team with our work, thus allowing me to fulfill my first learning goal
      </p>

      <h2>Goal 2: Troubleshoot and resolve development bugs in software services</h2>
      <p>
        With my team’s main duty being to resolve production issues, It is natural that my goal for this co-op is to learn to debug efficiently through multiple tasks. 
        During the tasks, I would make notes of the expected and actual values to see the difference using a debugger. 
        Once I got that part done, I would be able to narrow down the problem to a smaller area for further debugging and solving the problem.
        <br><br>
        The debugging skill I learned from this goal will help me when I create my own software in the future by making design patterns that separate functionality and 
        knowing what to look for when debugging.
      </p>

      <h2>Goal 3: Experience using technologies like Docker and Kubernetes to deploy software services</h2>
      <p>
        A responsibility I have for this work term is maintaining and updating Docker and Kubernetes services. 
        The tasks I completed involved keeping the services up to date, fixing any instabilities, and optimizing system resources used. 
        At the end of the work term, I feel rather confident in the technologies. 
        I got to experience using a technology that many companies will be using to host their microservices, and since I’ve learned how to use 
        Kubernetes and Docker will make me a more desirable candidate.
      </p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        There are varieties of different roles in software development. 
        Some are focused on the front end while others are focused on backend. 
        In this co-op term, I learned a lot about backend development skills through different learning goals I set for myself in the work term. 
        In my future work, I believe my skillset would make me a valuable candidate when looking for backend development.
