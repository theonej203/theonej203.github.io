      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Johnson Controls, also known as JCI, is a company that focuses on building equipment and building administration. 
        During this work term and the previous four months, I was working on developing software as a Cloud Developer to work with JCIâ€™s PowerManage, 
        which is a service management system.
      </p>

      <h1>Job requirements</h1>
      <p>
        The posted job requirements include two different roles: Cloud and Mobile Development. 
        As I was selected for Cloud Development, I will outline the skills this position is looking for.
        <br>
        The technical skills that this position prefers are experience with NodeJS and REST APIs. 
        It also uses AWS and its different services. The position will also require knowledge of Agile methodology, like daily standup and sprint planning.
      </p>

      <h1>Learning Goals</h1>
      <p>
        Since I had already been working at JCI for 4 months as an intern before starting this co-op term, I learned many of the basics of Cloud development. 
        My learning goal is to help me improve these skills.
      </p>

      <h2>Goal 1: Able to run AWS services efficiently</h2>
      <p>
        During this work term, I was able to take on some tasks that involved replacing the AWS Simple Email Service with a more cost-effective solution. 
        In the process of completing the tasks, I learned a lot about the email service we are using. 
        In the end, I was able to save a good amount of money migrating to our alternative email system.
      </p>

      <h2>Goal 2: Gain a deeper understanding of AWS templates, like serverless and saml.</h2>
      <p>
        During the work term, I was working on modifying a DynamoDB to use other attributes as indexes to make searching easier.
         As I was doing the tasks, I learned about many quarks about DynamoDB, as indexing attributes should always exist. 
        Because of this change, our team can search for attributes more easily, it also reduces read unit usage, which will lead to lower bills.
      </p>

      <h2>Goal 3: Have a deeper understanding of business logic</h2>
      <p>
        During this work term, I got a chance to work on a project that spams multiple teams. 
        During the tasks, I was able to communicate with other teams about the status of the work on our end, and how it will impact our customers. 
        This task was able to provide me with an in-depth understanding of our business structure, allowing me to better suit the company's needs.
      </p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        At the end of this work term, I feel like my knowledge of Backend Development is improving. 
        I was able to not only develop codes for our customers but to maintain and improve them as well. 
        Not only did I learn generic technical skills like JavaScript coding, but I was able to use it with AWS as well.
