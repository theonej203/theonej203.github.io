      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Johnson Controls, also known as JCI, is a company that focuses on building equipment and building administration. 
        Similar to my previous report, I was working on new features for software as a Cloud Developer to work with JCIâ€™s PowerManage and Connect 24.
      </p>

      <h1>Job requirements</h1>
      <p>
        The posted job requirements include two different roles: Cloud and Mobile Development.
        As I was selected for and still working as a Cloud Development, the skill is still the same as outlined in previous report.
        <br>
        The technical skills that this position prefers are experience with NodeJS and REST APIs. 
        It also uses AWS and its different services. The position will also require knowledge of Agile methodology, like daily standup and sprint planning.
      </p>

      <h1>Learning Goals</h1>
      <p>
        Since I had already been working at JCI for 8 months as an intern before starting this co-op term, I learned many of the basics of Cloud development. 
        My learning goals are mainly here to help me improve my soft skills.
      </p>

      <h2>Goal 1: Have a better understanding for a task's purpose.</h2>
      <p>	
        I feel implementing this method does help me to be more productive in my work by reducing the 
        time I have to wait for clarifications. This is an improvement from before when I will try to 
        understand difficult tasks without getting validation first, which will still led to the same 
        conversation I will have.
      </p>

      <h2>Goal 2: Learn the basics quickly.</h2>
      <p>
        During this work term, I was working on a new project that will be using a different programming languages. 
        For that project, I focus on learning the required functionality. This allow me to focus on the important 
        features instead of trying to learn everything at once.
      </p>

      <h2>Goal 3: Document code changes and scripts I made so team members can know the purpose and use it properly.</h2>
      <p>
        During this work term, I added more documentation to my code by adding clearer comments. 
        This is to prepare for new members joining near the end of the term. I was able to write 
        clearer code, as the new team members were able to understand it.
      </p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        At the end of this work term, I feel like not only knowledge of Backend Development is improving, 
        but I've becomming better at doing general non-porgramming tasks. I was able to identify business needs 
        in additions to be able to implement solutions in code. This allows me to be able to work on higher level
        works like designing solutions better.
