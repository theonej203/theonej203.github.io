      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Sheridan College, one of the best post-secondary institutions specialises in preparing students with knowledge to join the workforce. 
        With over 30,000 students attending the three colleges across the Greater Toronto Area, 
        one way the school can support these students' learning is through free tutoring services. 
        In this work-term blog, I will be telling about my duty as one of the Applied Computing Tutors and the invaluable skills obtained working as one.
      </p>

      <h1>Job requirements</h1>
      <p>
        As an applied computing tutor, I will need to be familiar with many concepts that I learned throughout my first year, 
        and some from my second year. These include: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>algebra</li>
        <li>Vectors and matrices</li>
        <li>Discrete maths</li>
        <li>Programming fundamentals with Python</li>
        <li>Object-oriented programming with Java</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Although it is ideal to know all the concepts, it is not the most important property of a good tutor.
        The most important properties of a tutor are
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>be patient when a student is taking some time trying to learn</li>
        <li>be understanding when some specific methods don’t work for certain student</li>
        <li>be adaptive to different learning styles, especially when their professors taught them a certain way</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As I outlined all the important information about this role, I will now justify my learning goals for this work term. 
        As one of the main end goals I want to achieve from this work term is to improve my educator skills for future teaching assistant roles, 
        the work term goals will be tailored to that end goal.
      </p>
      <h1>Learning Goals</h1>
      <h2>Goal 1: Develop practice content to cover materials for the week effectively</h2>
      <p>
        One of the ways applied computing tutors teach students is through group study sessions. 
        This study session typically covers content from last week. During the session, 
        the students can either use it to ask questions on the subject or request a formal study session, 
        where I would go over content from the past week. A way I would use to determine my content efficiency, 
        in addition to direct feedback from students, is student attendance as more students could mean better 
        content coverage of the content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the semester, the number of students attending the session does increase to a certain point. 
        The reviews from the students themselves also imply that they are clearing up any confusion from the past week. 
        So overall, I can develop content that the students can learn from effectively.
      </p>
      <h2>Goal 2: Communicate concepts and ideas with students efficiently</h2>
      <p>
        Related to the first goal, this is to check if the student remembers the topic I covered in a previous session as that is the main goal. 
        For me to check their understanding, 
        I would incorporate part of the previous topic in an example question and use tools like Kahoot at the end of the session to check their understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, most of the students can remember the concepts as most of them completed my assessments with not much trouble.
      </p>
      <h2>Goal 3: Able to provide more specific help to student based on their needs</h2>
      <p>
        Every person is unique, meaning that they learn differently. A lesson that works with one may not work with others. 
        Because of this, I almost always have hands-on examples accompany my lessons, 
        so the students can try them out and see for themselves so they can know why something works and something doesn’t. 
        If that is not enough, I encourage the students to book one-on-one sessions with me. 
        In the end, I believe I successfully provided them with their specific needs to enhance their learning experience.
      </p>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        There are many things an applied computing tutor needs. 
        First, they do need to know or have the capacity to learn the subject they are teaching. 
        They also need to be able to develop engaging and effective lessons for students. 
        Most important of all, be understanding when a student doesn’t automatically understand the concepts. 
        At the end of my co-op term, I believe I showed and learned most of these traits to the students I taught. T
        his has been a successful co-op work term for me. I truly enjoy my time interacting with the other faculty members and students.
